# Registrar-Java-Swing-LinkedList
Goal:  Create a Swing app with linked lists to swap names from one list to another.

Main method is in the Controller.java class.

Testing of the sorting attributes and minor testing of the Student class is included.

This started as a small assignment for one of my courses in which we had to create a LinkedList of students
and make it sortable by the three values (id, first name, last name). It later got expanded to allow for the
addition of a student from the Registrar class into a specific Roster.

Upon completion of the new task, I then split out the GUI, then moved the logic into an actual controller to
make it more of an MVC GUI application.
